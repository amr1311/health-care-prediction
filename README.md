Cardiovascular Disease Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases using various machine learning techniques. It demonstrates the end-to-end data science process, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.

Overview
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection can save lives and improve patient outcomes. This project aims to build a predictive model that can assess a personâ€™s risk based on health indicators such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.

Tools & Technologies
Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, Matplotlib)
TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)
Power BI (for dashboard and data visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (for development and documentation)

Key Steps
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, normalization, and feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends in cardiovascular health data.

Modeling
Training and comparing multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks) for prediction.

Evaluation
Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.

Visualization
Creating meaningful visualizations and Power BI dashboards to communicate results.

Dataset

The dataset used is publicly available and contains anonymized medical records of patients, including features like age, gender, cholesterol, blood pressure, and smoking habits.

Goals

Predict the presence or risk of cardiovascular disease.

Understand which health indicators are most influential.

Provide a foundation for building clinical decision support tools.
